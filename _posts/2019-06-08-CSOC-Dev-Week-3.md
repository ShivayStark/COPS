Hello and welcome to the week 3 of CSOC Dev. This week will cover essential web backend development using the popular web framework - Django!

## What is Django?
A Python-based web framework for 'perfectionists with deadlines', it is a battle-tested framework used to make websites from personal website to web apps for big companies like Instagram. One of its core principles is [**DRY** ](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/misc/design-philosophies/) and promotes building a web app using [**MVC architecture**](https://medium.com/shecodeafrica/understanding-the-mvc-pattern-in-django-edda05b9f43f). [This article](https://djangobook.com/mdj2-django-structure/) is helpful to understand its project structure.
